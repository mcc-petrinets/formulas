hoa-mode.el is used when building the documentation for syntax
highlighting the HOA files displayed in the examples.  But you may
also want to use it for editing and displaying HOA files.

Old versions of org-mode have a version of ob-dot.el that do not
correctly deal with backslashs in dot output.  This version fixes
that.
