  /// \brief Complement a deterministic TωA
  ///
  /// The automaton \a aut should be deterministic.  It will be
  /// completed if it isn't already.  In these conditions,
  /// complementing the automaton can be done by just complementing
  /// the acceptance condition.
  ///
  /// In particular, this implies that an input that use
  /// generalized Büchi will be output as generalized co-Büchi.
  ///
  /// Functions like to_generalized_buchi() or remove_fin() are
  /// frequently called after dtwa_complement() to obtain an easier
  /// acceptance condition (maybe at the cost of losing determinism.)
  ///
  /// This function was deprecated in spot 2.4. Call the function
  /// spot::dualize() instead, that is able to complement any input
  /// automaton, not only deterministic ones.
